**Project Description:** 

Created a project which allows vehichle to charge simultaneously depending on the available charging resources.
1. Simulation of the system allowing vehicles to charge simultaneously 1..N vehicles - depending on the available resources. 
   <br/>
     <br/> 
3. Simulation of the charging of cars in parallel at 2..N charging stations - car arriving in random moment of time. 
   <br/>
     <br/> 
5. When the car appear in the queue should be calculated the waiting time, if time is more then 15 min car leaving the queue. 
   <br/>
     <br/> 
7. Multithread simuation - charging of the reserved batteries from several energy sources.
