**Project Description:** 

Created a capstone project with the following functionality to our project:
<br/> 
1. Add logs files for each day for each charging station, for each energy source and for all system as whole. 
   <br/> 
2. Give user the possibility to open the requested log file based on the name of the equipment or date.
    <br/> 
3. Develop simulation of the Car charging station with several alternative sources of energy. 
      <br/>
4. Booking timeslots for each car and making priority queues. 
   <br/>    
5. Several car charging stations are available with n location in it. Only one car can be in one charging location.
      <br/> 
6. Charging one car takes a fixed time. If all places are occupied, the car will not wait for more than a certain time and will go to another car charging station. 
      <br/> 
7. Simulate the weather conditions to log the situation at the charging station and switch between the energy sources.
      <br/> 
8. Simulate the management system for the energy sources and added functionality for concurrency and multithreading.
   
9. Created loggersystem and metadata.
       <br/> 
10. Created unit tests for each class
